#BST
user need provide compare function for node compare
this function is for two condition :
1. when add node used it get big or small
2. when find / del used it to get equal

so the data must be designed like follow:
must have a key in your struct to decide your struct's status bigger smaller equal, and provide function judge it

#compare function

*
*  return :
*  0 data1 == data2 
*  1 data1 > data2 
*  2 data1 < data2
*

typedef int ( * Tcompare_func_BST ) ( void * data1, void * data2 )
